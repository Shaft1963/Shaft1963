👋 Greetings, I’m @Shaft1963 aka. David Shaffer

👀 I’m interested in Learning new ways that I can help others attain their goals and improve the tools and best practices I'm already using to that end.

🌱 I’m currently learning what I can about software development. I'm constantly learning so many things about 'Life the Universe and Everything' and this is something I don't foresee as changing anytime soon...

💞️ I’m available to collaborate on Computer Hardware, Creative Writing, Senior Services, Human Psychology and Mentorship. These are my strengths and areas I could offer experienced insights and at least a modicum of insightful guidance. I would be eternally grateful if I found myself in a 'Student-Mentor' relationship, with me as the student of course, concerning Software Development.

📫 I can be reached by text at (909) 300-5617 or by written correspondence at: davidshafferinc@gmail.com

😊 I'm glad to be here, Thank you for your interest.

👍 Respectfully, David M. Shaffer
